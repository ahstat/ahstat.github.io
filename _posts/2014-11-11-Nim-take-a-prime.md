The *Nim function for take-a-prime game* is a math sequence with interesting patterns. 
We define this sequence $$(u_n)$$ recursively. For all $$n$$ in $$\mathbb{N}$$ (the set of non-negative integers), $$u_n$$ is the lowest number in $$\mathbb{N}$$ such that for all prime number $$p$$ (with $$n-p \geq 0$$), $$u_n \neq $$u_{n-p}$$.

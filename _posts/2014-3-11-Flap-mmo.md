<a title="FlapMMO game" href="http://flapmmo.com/" target="_blank">F</a><a title="FlapMMO game" href="http://flapmmo.com/" target="_blank">lapMMO</a> is an online game similar to Flappy Bird. The player controls a bird and the aim is to fly as far as possible, avoiding the pipes. At the same time, you see other players playing.

In this post, an exploration of a dataset of scores is performed, using descriptive statistics and testing some probabilistic models.


<strong>Retrieving data.</strong> Thanks to the work of <a href="http://t3hz0r.com/post/analysis-flapmmo-attempts" target="_blank">Connor Sauve</a>, it is possible to retrieve the flow of data, which contains for each attempt useful information as:
<ul>
	<li>an id field, which uniquely identify the player,</li>
	<li>a nickname,</li>
	<li>a date,</li>
	<li>a list of dates of jump (from the beginning to the end of the attempt).</li>
</ul>
Finally, I get two datasets:
<ul>
	<li><em>data0</em>, obtained by Connor Sauve on 13 Feb 2014, which contains about 400,000 attempts with more than 18,000 different players,</li>
	<li><em>data1</em>, obtained by myself on 2 Mar 2014, which contains about 100,000 attempts with more than 5,000 players.</li>
</ul>
In the next plots, <em>data1</em> will be used. In the last paragraph, a brief comparison between the two datasets is done.

<strong>Variable of interest.</strong> For each id, I only focus on the successive pipes where the bird bangs. Then, I transform my datasets to obtain something like this:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>id</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">attempt 1</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">attempt 2</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">attempt 3</th>
<th style="text-align:left;">attempt 4</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3266</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">2</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">1</td>
<td style="text-align:left;"></td>
<td style="text-align:right;"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3267</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3268</td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3269</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3270</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>

For example, we can see that player with the id 3266 played 2 times. In his first try, his bird banged the second pipe. In his next try, his bird banged the first pipe. Then he stopped to play.

Note that I removed the attempts which do not reach the first pipe.



<strong>How much time each player continues to play?</strong> In the following graph, I plot the frequency of players as a function of the number of attempts.<strong>
</strong>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttempts1.png"/>
</p>

We observe that most of people only play a few times: 50% of the players play 10 times or less, and 75% of the them try less than 25 attempts.

From this plot, we deduce the probability that a player plays again as a function of the number of attempts done.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttemptsConditional1.png"/>
</p>

This plot suggests that the more a player tries the game, the more he continues to play. It might reveal that the game is addictive.

<strong>How far each player go?</strong> The next descriptive graph represents the frequency of players as a function of the pipe reached in their best play.<strong>
</strong>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/maxBanged1.png"/>
</p>

Here, we observe that most players are able to pass a pipe, but 50% of them don't reach the fifth pipe and 75% lose before the eighth pipe. It is noteworthy that someone reached the 140th pipe (outside of the graph).

<strong>Evolution of the score between two consecutive tries.</strong> Knowing the score (the pipe where the bird bangs) of a player for an attempt, we want to infer the score of the next try. For this purpose, we use a homogeneous Markov model. This is a simplistic model, because the next score may depend on all the history of scores (not a one step Markov model), and on the number of attempts the player has already done (not a homogeneous model).



An empirical transition matrix is obtained, where each cell <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/ij.png"/> represents the probability that a player who scores <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/i.png"/> in a try will score <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/j.png"/> in the next try. Only 10 states are kept:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/states.png"/>.</p>

Here '<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/state_sup.png"/>' represents a score greater than 8 and '<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/state_dag.png"/>' means that the player stopped to play.
The matrix is given by:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/matrix1.png"/>
</p>

For example, the probability that a player who scores 1 in a try will score 6 in the next try is 0.02=2%. The probability that a player who scores greater than 8 will leave the game is 0.09=9%.

From this matrix, we represent the probability to score 1 (respectively to score greater than 8) in the next try as a function of the current try.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/markovBang1.png"/>
</p>

We deduce that players who score high for a try tend to score high in the next try, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTeqM5gciH8" target="_blank">vice versa</a>. Then, this game is not a random game.

Also from the matrix, we plot the probability to leave the game as a function of the current try.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/markovQuit1.png"/>
</p>

Thus, people who reach great scores are more likely to leave the game.

<strong>Skill of players.</strong> Now, we take players individually and for each of them, we want to measure his skill. Letting <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/1toN.png"/> the players, we only make the following assumption:

"when the bird of the player k is in front of a pipe, it dies with probability <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/p_k.png"/>".

Then for the player <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/k.png"/>, each score follow a geometric distribution (on <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/Nstar.png"/>) with rate <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/p_k.png"/>. After estimation of the rates for all players, we plot the histogram of rates for players who make more than 30 attempts.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/30.png"/> 
</p>

The distribution of rates is not uniform and most of players (with more than 30 attempts) have a rate around 0.5.

Note that the geometric hypothesis was tested with the Cramer-von Mises test, and for almost all the players, the hypothesis of geometric distribution could not be rejected with this test (even for players who play many times).

<strong>Evolution of the skill.</strong> The previous model could not exhibit the evolution of the skill when a player is making many attempts. To fix that, we modify the previous assumption by:

"when the bird of the player <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/k.png"/> is in front of a pipe, letting <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/l.png"/> the number of attempts already done by the player, it dies with probability <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/p_kl.png"/>".

We use a <a title="convolution is used to smooth functions" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Convolution_of_box_signal_with_itself2.gif" target="_blank">uniform convolution</a> to estimate each rate <img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/latex/p_kl.png"/>. Then, for players who make many attempts, we can observe if their skills increase well or not. Here the plots for players 1725, 1433 and 4147.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttempts1andPlayer1725.png"/>
</p>

Player 1725 begins without knowing how to play and then constantly improves his performance.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttempts1andPlayer1433.png"/>
</p>

Player 1433 knows how to play, and his skill improvment is slow.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttempts1andPlayer4147.png"/>
</p>

Player 4147 played many times but its skill remains more or less constant.

<strong>Comparison between <em>data0</em> and <em>data1</em>.</strong> The shape of all plots looks similar, except that in data1 the skill of players is greater.

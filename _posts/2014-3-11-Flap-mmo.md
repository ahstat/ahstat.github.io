<a title="FlapMMO game" href="http://flapmmo.com/" target="_blank">F</a><a title="FlapMMO game" href="http://flapmmo.com/" target="_blank">lapMMO</a> is an online game similar to Flappy Bird. The player controls a bird and the aim is to fly as far as possible, avoiding the pipes. At the same time, you see other players playing.

In this post, an exploration of a dataset of scores is performed, using descriptive statistics and testing some probabilistic models.


<strong>Retrieving data.</strong> Thanks to the work of <a href="http://t3hz0r.com/post/analysis-flapmmo-attempts" target="_blank">Connor Sauve</a>, it is possible to retrieve the flow of data, which contains for each attempt useful information as:
<ul>
	<li>an id field, which uniquely identify the player,</li>
	<li>a nickname,</li>
	<li>a date,</li>
	<li>a list of dates of jump (from the beginning to the end of the attempt).</li>
</ul>
Finally, I get two datasets:
<ul>
	<li><em>data0</em>, obtained by Connor Sauve on 13 Feb 2014, which contains about 400,000 attempts with more than 18,000 different players,</li>
	<li><em>data1</em>, obtained by myself on 2 Mar 2014, which contains about 100,000 attempts with more than 5,000 players.</li>
</ul>
In the next plots, <em>data1</em> will be used. In the last paragraph, a brief comparison between the two datasets is done.

<strong>Variable of interest.</strong> For each id, I only focus on the successive pipes where the bird bangs. Then, I transform my datasets to obtain something like:

| id   | attempt 1  | attempt 2 | attempt 3 | attempt 4 | 
| ---- | ---------- | ----------| ----------| ----------|
| 3266 | 2          | 1         |           |           |
| 3267 | 1          | 6         | 2         | 3         |
| 3268 | 1          |           |           |           |
| 3269 | 1          | 1         | 1         |           |
| 3270 | 2          | 10        | 5         | 1         |


For example, we see that the player with the id 3266 plays 2 times. In his first try, his bird banged the second pipe. In his next try, his bird banged the first pipe. Then he stopped to play.

Note that I remove the attempts which do not reach the first pipe.

<strong>How much time each player continues to play?</strong> In the following graph, I plot the frequency of players as a function of the number of attempts.<strong>
</strong>

<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttempts1.png"/>

We observe that most of people only play a few times: 50% of the players play 10 times or less, and 75% of the them try less than 25 attempts.

From this plot, we deduce the probability that a player plays again as a function of the number of attempt done.

This plot suggests that the more a player tries the game, the more he continues to play. It might reveal that the game is addictive.

<strong>How far each player go?</strong> The next descriptive graph represents the frequency of players as a function of the pipe reached in their best play.<strong>
</strong>

<img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/maxBanged1.png"/>

Here, we observe that most players are able to pass a pipe, but 50% of them don't reach the fifth pipe and 75% lose before the eighth pipe. <b>It is noteworthy</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>h</b><b>at</b> someone reached the 140th pipe (outside of the graph).

<strong>Evolution of the score between two consecutive tries.</strong> Knowing the score (the pipe where the bird bangs) of a player for an attempt, we want to infer the score of the next try. For this purpose, we use a homogeneous Markov model. This is a simplistic model, because the next score may depend on all the history of scores (not a one step Markov model), and on the number of attempts the player has already done (not a homogeneous model).

An empirical transition matrix is obtained, where each cell (i,j) represents the probability that a player who scores i in a try will score j in the next try. Only 10 states are kept:
<p style="text-align:center;">{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, > , ? }.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Here ">" represents a score greater than 8 and "?" means that the player stopped to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The matrix is given by:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/matrix1.png"/>For example, the probability that a player who scores 1 in a try will score 6 in the next try is 0.02=2%. The probability that a player who scores greater than 8 will leave the game is 0.09=9%.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">From this matrix, we represent the probability to score 1 (respectively to score greater than 8) in the next try as a function of the current try.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/markovBang1.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We deduce that players who score high for a try tend to score high in the next try, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTeqM5gciH8" target="_blank">vice versa</a>. Then, this game is not a random game.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Also from the matrix, we plot the probability to leave the game as a function of the current try.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/markovQuit1.png"/>Thus, people who reach great scores are more likely to leave the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Skill of players.</strong> Now, we take players individually and for each of them, we want to measure his skill. Letting {1,...,N} the players, we only make the following assumption:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"when the bird of the player k is in front of a pipe, it dies with probability p_{k}".</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Then for the player k, each score follow a geometric distribution (on <strong>N</strong>*) with rate p_{k}. After estimation of the rates for all players, we plot the histogram of rates for players who make more than 30 attempts.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/30.png"/> The distribution of rates is not uniform and most of players (with more than 30 attempts) have a rate around 0.5.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Note that the geometric hypothesis was tested with the Cramer-von Mises test, and for almost all the players, the hypothesis of geometric distribution could not be rejected with this test (even for players who play many times).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Evolution of the skill.</strong> The previous model could not exhibit the evolution of the skill when a player is making many attempts. To fix that, we modify the previous assumption by:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"when the bird of the player k is in front of a pipe, letting l the number of attempts already done by the player, it dies with probability p_{k,l}".</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">We use a <a title="convolution is used to smooth functions" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Convolution_of_box_signal_with_itself2.gif" target="_blank">uniform convolution</a> to estimate each rate p_{k,l}. Then, for players who make many attempts, we can observe if their skills increase well or not. Here the plots for players 1725, 1433 and 4147.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttempts1andPlayer1725.png"/>Player 1725 begins without knowing how to play and then constantly improves his performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttempts1andPlayer1433.png"/>Player 1433 knows how to play, and his skill improvment is slow.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img src="../images/2014-3-11-Flap-mmo/numberAttempts1andPlayer4147.png"/>Player 4147 played many times but its skill remains more or less constant.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Comparison between <em>data0</em> and <em>data1</em>.</strong> The shape of all plots looks similar, except that in data1 the skill of players is greater.</p>

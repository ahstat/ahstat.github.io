title: Coal&#58; Composition of Linear Functions
published: true
---
Coal is a small software dedicated to automatize composition of linear functions.
For example, it can compute slope, intercept and fixed point of *gfg* given
*f: x ↦ ax+b* and 
*g:&nbsp;x&nbsp;↦&nbsp;cx+d*.
Here, *a* and *b* can be formal letters, rational values or real values.

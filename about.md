I'm Alexis Huet. I got a PhD of mathematics in 2014 from the University of Lyon (France). I'm working in data science.

On this blog, I provide detailed posts about deep learning, data science with maths flavor, and own projects. I code in R ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/R_logo.png) and Python ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Python_logo.png), sometimes in Javascript ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Javascript_logo.png) and C++ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Cpp_logo.png).

### About deep learning

- [RNN with Keras: Predicting time series](https://ahstat.github.io/RNN-Keras-time-series/) ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Python_logo.png) Complete introduction of time series prediction with RNN. This tutorial has been written for answering a [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41947039/keras-rnn-with-lstm-cells-for-predicting-multiple-output-time-series-based-on-mu/48521460#48521460), and has been used later [in a real-world context](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48929272/non-linear-multivariate-time-series-response-prediction-using-rnn/49666510#49666510).

- [RNN with Keras: Understanding computations](https://ahstat.github.io/RNN-Keras-understanding-computations/) ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Python_logo.png) Highlights structure of common RNN algorithms by following computations carried out by each model. It provides a clear summary of command lines, math equations and diagrams.

### About maths in data science

- [Optimizing GMM parameters using EM](https://ahstat.github.io/Optimizing-GMM-using-EM/). Description of GMM; How to update parameters using EM; Illustration on a simple example. Unlike many other sources, I fully detail parameters' update using gradient and Hessian.

- [Rediscover EM algorithm from scratch](https://ahstat.github.io/Rediscover-EM-algorithm/). Many introductions of EM exist on the web. This one starts from the likelihood computation problem and uses inductive reasoning to bring out EM.

- [Computation of the gradient for SNE](https://ahstat.github.io/Gradient-for-SNE/). Deriving gradient of the SNE algorithm, fully detailed.

- [An illustration of Metropolis–Hastings algorithm](https://ahstat.github.io/Metropolis-Hastings-example/). Toy example for understanding Metropolis–Hastings algorithm on a simple example.

- [Maximizing likelihood is equivalent to minimizing KL-divergence](https://ahstat.github.io/Kullback-Leibler-divergence/). Restating this classic equivalence in my "own" words.

- [Introduction to hidden Markov models](https://github.com/ahstat/introduction-hmm) ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/R_logo.png) Introduction to hidden Markov models on finite state spaces, following the tutorial of L. R. Rabiner.

### Own projects

- [Langton's ant extended to Voronoi tessellations](https://ahstat.github.io/Langton-Voronoi/) ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/R_logo.png) A program extending Langton's ant to any Voronoi tessellation of the plane. Simulations show interesting walks for some partitions of the plane, including chaotic structures, highway patterns and even bounded evolutions.

- [Anabasis webapp](https://ahstat.github.io/Anabasis/) ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Javascript_logo.png) Webapp where players can draw collaborative paintings. It was built with node.js combined with mongodb, and hosted on Heroku and MLab. Analysis of collected data is also available [in this post](https://ahstat.github.io/Clickstream/).

- [Trigger snake](https://ahstat.github.io/Trigger-snake/) ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Cpp_logo.png) A challenging snake game built in C++/Qt4
